# Reviewer 1

- Q1: The likelihood of the attacker presence and its impact to the transmission process is measured based on empirical signal strengths, which may prove to be either / or not effective.
<br>
- A1: Added explanation to answer
<br>

<br>
<br>
- Q2: Whilst the idea is novel, the presentation is lacking in terms of how the scheme operates in the presence of an adversary which is constantly transmitting messages on the channel and pushing the other UEs to transmit at a higher power.
<br>
- A2: Add explanation that the equation can be modified to consider UE power ramping by multiplying individual access success probability of each Msg1 UE send (with power ramping)

<br>
<br>
- Q3: In particular, Section III is not very strong in terms of justification of the resilience of the proposed scheme to adversarial jamming attacks.
<br>
- A3: There is no proposed scheme to defense against adversarial jamming attacks. The proposed scheme is just to evaluate the impact
<br>
<br>
- Q4: Consequently, the validation presented in Section IV is not evidently backed with strong theoretical foundations.
<br>
- A4: I don't understand the statement. What kind of theoretical foundations is the reviewer talking about?
<br>
<br>
- Q5: Reasons for choosing attacker transmission intervals at 1, 2 and 16 are not clear.
<br>
- A5: Give reason of choosing transmission interval

# Reviewer 2

- Q1: While some references are given in the introduction, the paper is missing a clear and dedicated related work section, so that the authors can further highlight the novelty of their solution.
<br>
- A1: Add related work section
<br>
<img width="211" height="142" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f14dddc-bfd7-4c97-8cd8-a08aecdb36b9" />
- <br>
<br>
- Q2: Please avoid using generic titles for figures, such Experiment 1, Experiment 2, Experiment 3.
<br>
- A2: Already changed figure titles
<br>

<br>
<br>
- Q3: The title should refer to 5G and B5G networks, and not cellular networks (which looks a bit old).
<br>
- A3: Changed the title
<br>

# Reviewer 3

- Q1: All the acronyms need to be defined in the text the first time that they are used, even if they have already been defined in the abstract.
<br>
- A1: Added the acronyms of the text first time they are used
<br>
- <img width="510" height="229" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4869330d-c36e-45ba-b997-153024c10488" />
<br>
<br>
- Q2: In the abstract you refer to "gNB" without definining it. I think you should define it even there.
<br>
- A2: Added the acronym for "gNB"
<br>
- <img width="507" height="176" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f720c2e8-a53c-4c5e-b834-707f21dcd07a" />
<br>
<br>
- Q3: When in the introduction you talk about your contribution it feels like you are constanlty repeating yourself, but adding small details to focus on different aspects. I suggest you to rephrase it or to consider even making a dedicated subsection.
<br>
- A3: Rephrase contribution to shorter, non repetitive
<br>
- <img width="510" height="408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06efae03-950d-43d6-bb27-1c03b4158d3a" />
<br>
<br>
- Q4: In Section III-A, when you refer to alpha, I asked myself what if it is minor than 0. Later on you make it clear that it is either major that 0 or 0. I would explain it better even in III-A.
<br>
- A4: Added clarification for alpha, beta, gamma values
<br>
- <img width="438" height="439" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85312f5d-e189-4636-ba6c-a55ef01da674" />
<br>
<br>
- Q5: In Section III-C, three rows before equation 3, I believe there is a spelling error: "that" should have been "than". Please verify it and in case correct it.
<br>
- A5: Fixed typo
<br>
